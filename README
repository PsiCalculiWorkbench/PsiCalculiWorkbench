Psi-calculi Workbench (Pwb)
---------------------------

Pwb is a generic tool and framework for implementing process calculi. It
is based on the concurrency framework psi-calculi. Pwb allows for
writing calculi which are parametric on data, and logics. Pwb provides
(weak and strong) symbolic bisimulation checking and execution.


Installing
----------

Pwb depends on the Poly/ML compiler of Standard ML. You can fetch it from
www.polyml.org.

Linux and Mac OS X
------------------

Typically Poly/ML can be install using a systems package manager:
on Debian: apt-get install polyml, on Mac OS X it is available on both MacPorts
and brew: 'port install polyml' and 'brew install polyml'.

Unpack the tarball and set the environment variable PSI_WORKBENCH_HOME to the
unpacked directory:

cd PsiWorkBench-yyyy.dd
export PSI_WORKBENCH_HOME=`pwd`
export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`/tools"


Windows
-------

On windows, you need Cygwin (http://cygwin.com/). Install Cygwin together
with gcc packages. Compile and install Poly/ML from www.polyml.org.

In cygwin shell, execute:

cd PsiWorkBench-yyyy.dd
export PSI_WORKBENCH_HOME=`pwd`
export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`/tools"


Running
-------

The main Pwb driver is located in tools/pwb. If you have set the environment
variables as described in installing section, you should be able to execute:

$ pwb

To load example calculi, for example, pi-calculus found in psi-instances/:

$ cd psi-instances/
$ pwb load-instance pi.ML
    ...
pwb>

This uses the compiler in the interpreter mode. At the pwb> prompt type 'help'
and enter to see the available commands.

For development of new instances and pwb itself, you should use pwb as wrapper
for the compiler to properly load the dependencies, as:

$ pwb sml @file.ML
