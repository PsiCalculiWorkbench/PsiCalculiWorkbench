Psi-calculi Workbench (Pwb)
---------------------------

Pwb is a generic framework for implementing psi-calculi and a set of tools for
analysing processes in the resulting calculi. Take a look at the 'examples/'
directory and the README file therein, for example implementations.

For more information, go to [2].

Prerequisites
-------------

To run Psi-calculi Workbench, you need a working copy of Poly/ML [1] (version
5.4 and up). Other SML implementations may work, but only Poly/ML has been
tested.

Pwb expects that the environment variable PSI_WORKBENCH_HOME is set to the Pwb
directory.

You might want to put 'tools/psi' on the PATH. It is the frontend to other Pwb
tools. To see what can be done with 'tools/psi', take a look at the output of
'tools/psi help'.
