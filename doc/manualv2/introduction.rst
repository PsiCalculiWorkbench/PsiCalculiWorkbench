Introduction
============

Psi-Calculi Workbench (Pwb) is a tool for Psi-calculi. Pwb is structured as a
framework; it provides a backbone for the concurrency semantics based on
Psi-calculi (and in turn on the pi-calculus). Out of the box you do not get
everyting needed to 'play' with processes but unlike other similar tools you
tailor the tool to your liking and need. What this means is that Pwb does the
simulation of processes, generates bisimilarity but the user (or rather
implementer of an Psi-calculi instance for Pwb) give specific meaning of
transitions and bisimulations by means of constraint solving.
